The \emph{University Classes Schedule Problem} (\textbf{UCSP})
consists in finding all the \emph{required disciplines} for each \emph{group}
at some academic period. It doesn't really matter whether the
\emph{disciplines} are chosen by the students or assigned by the
institution. Anyway, the \textbf{primary task} for the ``ants'' is to encounter
\textbf{valid} configurations of \emph{classes}, such that provide exactly
the \emph{required time} of each \emph{required discipline} for each \emph{group}.
The \textbf{secondary task} is to encounter the solution, that provides the best
\emph{satisfaction} by the represented persons and the institution.
